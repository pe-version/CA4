# REQUIRED: Your SSH key pair name in AWS (without .pem extension)
# Create one with: aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name ca3-k3s --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > ~/.ssh/ca3-k3s.pem && chmod 400 ~/.ssh/ca3-k3s.pem

# REQUIRED: Your public IP address for SSH access
# Get your IP: curl ifconfig.me
# IMPORTANT: Must be in CIDR notation with /32 suffix

# Optional overrides (defaults are set in variables.tf)
# aws_region = "us-east-2"
# node_count = 3
# project_name = "CA3-K3s-3Node"
# ebs_volume_size = 20

# Instance types (defaults: balanced config)
# master_instance_type = "t3.small"    # Control plane + observability (~$0.50/day)
# worker_1_instance_type = "t3.medium" # Data services (Kafka needs RAM) (~$1/day)
# worker_2_instance_type = "t3.small"  # App services (lightweight) (~$0.50/day)
# Total: ~$2/day or ~$60/month

# Budget alternatives:
# Option 1 - All small (TIGHT, may OOM on Kafka): all t3.small = ~$1.50/day
# Option 2 - Balanced (RECOMMENDED): t3.small, t3.medium, t3.small = ~$2/day
# Option 3 - All medium (COMFORTABLE): all t3.medium = ~$3/day

# Note: AMI ID is automatically selected for us-east-2
# For other regions, update ami_id in variables.tf:
# us-east-1: ami-0557a15b87f6559cf
# us-west-2: ami-0aff18ec83b712f05
